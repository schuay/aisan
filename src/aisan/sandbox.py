"""The bind model: an ordered mount policy, rendered as a bubblewrap argv.

The mechanism is per-call confinement. With an in-process agent harness the
model's whole capability surface is its tools, so wrapping tool execution
confines the agent without a process boundary -- and the same wrapper serves a
box whose payload is one command. Each call runs inside a fresh bubblewrap mount
namespace (the job worktree rw at its real absolute path, declared dependencies
ro, everything else -- $HOME, other worktrees, the main checkout -- absent, not
merely denied), under a systemd transient scope for cgroup limits.

What the box may touch is one ordered list of binds, and the rule is bwrap's
own: a later mount wins where two overlap. There is no second precedence rule
layered on top -- no read-vs-write asymmetry, no field whose name encodes when
it is emitted. Reading the list top to bottom is reading the policy, which is
the property that makes a profile auditable.

Known give-ups of this tier, documented rather than papered over:
- Network is the host's unless `unshare_net` is set. With it set the box has
  no route off the machine at all; host-side proxies then reach it only through
  a bind-mounted UNIX socket, which is what the Vertex and RBE proxies do.
- No disk quota on the rw worktree (project quotas need root); only the tmpfs
  mounts are size-capped.
- /tmp is a fresh tmpfs per call: scratch there does not survive to the next
  shell call. Durable scratch needs an explicit persistent bind.
